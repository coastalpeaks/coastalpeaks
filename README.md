### Hi there 👋

Welcome to the coastal peaks git hub repo!

### What is coastal peaks? 🌊  

coastal peaks began out of a desire to create while sharing the feeling of stoke born out of adventure and discovery in the form of surfing and exploring the outdoors. in surfing the “peak” of the wave is the most powerful section – while the coast is where land meets the ocean, an important part of our natural ecosystem.

the products we create empower people to explore while making a positive impact for the planet and kindling the spirit of constant adventure and stoke. we are rooted in the outdoors and surfing lifestyle, striving to spread good vibes.
