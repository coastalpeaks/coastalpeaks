Hi there, ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the coastal peaks git hub repo!

Coastal Peaks originates from my love of surfing | the 'coast' is where the mountains meet the ocean - and in surfing the 'peak' of the wave is the most powerful section

What started out back in 2020 as a rapid prototype project from a desire to create and build to share the feeling of stoke through creative expression has continued to evolve into a space that allows for curiousity and learning while usin the latest technologies to bring new ideas to life from the perspective of a product manager that has continued to pioneer and push the boundaries of product management in technology. 

It's quite amazing to see a space that was born out of the spirit of exploring and constant discovery that created a brand that evolved from the intersection of surfing, exploration to joining that sense of discovery, and catching waves with modern technology.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Vibe Coding with Claude Code to bring new product ideas to life through rapid prototyping
- Sharing best practices for product development using Cloud Computing through my newest venture CloudByt3s - sharing 'byte' size blogs that help SMBs understand how to scale compute infrastructure without falling into common enterprise level traps with their architectures
